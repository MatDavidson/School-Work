    "The [Pima Indians dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database) is a very famous dataset distributed by UCI and originally collected from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. It contains data from clinical exams for 614 women age 21 and above of Pima indian origins. The objective is to predict, based on diagnostic measurements, whether a patient has diabetes.\n",

    "- SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)\n",
    "- Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)\n",
    "- BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)\n",
