I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear; nor did I wish to practise resignation, unless it was quite necessary. I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life, to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life, to cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms.” ― </b> <span class="redText""> <b>Henry David Thoreau (July 12, 1817 – May 6, 1862), Walden: Or, Life in the Woods</b>&nbsp;</span>
